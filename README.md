# RoutingPractice

This repository contains a basic Angular Project. The project uses the NgSwitch directive to change what "page" the user is
on when they click buttons in the header.

Your task is to convert this to Angular Routing. The buttons in the header should become links, the components
in the app template should be removed and replaced with a router outlet. The links in the header should also change 
their style to reflect which page is currently displayed

## Walkthrough
Try to figure this out on your own. If you get stuck, you can look at [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ubMXg-q2eMCxKlI5zy52q-yqK3yKgtlUbjcaas9TRPM/edit?usp=sharing) for help. It walks through every
step of the process, although it should be noted that there is more than one "right" answer.
